<p>You typically use Angular Universal to pre-render Angular pages on the server. Once the app then runs on the client, it's a normal SPA&nbsp;again.</p><p>Server-side rendering (SSR) can make sense because of SEO&nbsp;considerations (crawler should see what your users see) or because you want to deliver a finished page to your users (rather than creating the page in the browser).</p><p>But that also has one important implication: B<strong>ou MUST&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;use any browser-only APIs like </strong><code><strong>document.querySelector()</strong></code><strong>&nbsp; in your Angular code!</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Simply because it will execute on the server and there, such APIs are not available.</p><p>That's why, in this course,&nbsp;I&nbsp;recommended to <strong>use Angular features only</strong>:&nbsp;These features are safe to use because Angular will check if a certain API&nbsp;can be used before it uses it.</p>
